# Edit-Distance-Levenshtein-Python

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Levenshtein distance algorithm for measuring the similarity between two strings, considering word-level operations. It also provides the ability to ignore certain common words during calculations.


## Introduction

The Levenshtein distance, also known as the edit distance, quantifies the minimum number of operations (insertions, deletions, substitutions) required to transform one string into another. This implementation extends the algorithm to operate at the word level and allows you to ignore specified common words during calculations.
